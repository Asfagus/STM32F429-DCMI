# STM32F429-DCMI
DCMI testing with STM32F429-DISCOVERY and OV9655 camera

This programis made for a STM32F429 discovery board AND OV9655 camera. The demo program samples a 160x120 into the SRAM of the microcontroller, converts it into a BMP file and sends it by serial interface to a computer where it can be displayed.

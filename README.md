# STM32F429-DCMI usage example code

This program is made for a STM32F429 discovery board AND OV9655 camera. The demo program samples a 320x240px image from a OV9655 camera into the SRAM and encodes it into JPEG. It then transmits the image by serial to the computer where it can be displayed. The STM32F429 discovery board has actually external SDRAM but the project's goal is it, to solve this problem without any external SDRAM.

**Anvantages:** No external memory needed, small capture outputs, 1/80sec shutter time
**Disadvantages:** No VGA possible (only QVGA)

Hardware connections
--------------------
The STM32F429 discovery board must be connected to the camera to spectific pins

Installation/Building/Flashing
------------------------------
To be able to build this project, a modification in the ChibiOS submodule must be done:
- Make sure you have a GCC toolchain installed (http://www.wolinlabs.com/blog/linux.stm32.discovery.gcc.html)
- The compile it with **make**
- And then flash the STM32 with **make flash** (You probably have to adjust the variable **STLINK** in the Makefile)

Taking photos
-------------
- The programm initializes the camera once at startup by I2C.
- The programm will take a photo from the camera and transmit the encoded picture by UART on PD5. The red LED on the demoboard will light up while taking the picture.
- Thereafter the green LED on the discovery board will blink green to signal, that the board is idling.
